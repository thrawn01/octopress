<p>Due to the collaborative nature of <strong><em>git</em></strong>; over time
I begin to accumulate quite a few branches and working closely in a team
compounds this problem. Remembering what branch needs to be merged, and what
branches need a pull can tax the little grey cells.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>As a solution to this problem, I present <code>git wtf</code> Instead of trying to
explain what it is, lets just run <code>git wtf</code> and examine it’s output.</p>

<p>Here is a run of <code>git wtf</code> on a project at work</p>

<figure>
<pre>
<code>>> git wtf
<span class='yellow'>storage-node-metadata</span> (1/5) [origin]
    remotes/origin/storage-node-metadata
<span class='yellow'>master</span> [origin]
     remotes/origin/master
     remotes/cory/master <span class='green'>is 17 commits behind</span>
     remotes/upstream/master <span class='red'>is 2 commits ahead</span>
<span class='yellow'>sqlalchemy08</span> (2/2) [cory]
    remotes/cory/sqlalchemy08
<span class='yellow'>volume-manager</span> (5/0) [origin]
    remotes/origin/volume-manager
    remotes/cory/volume-manager <span class='green'>is 1 commits behind</span>
<span class='yellow'>branch-not-published</span> (2/0)
<span class='yellow'>update-documentation</span> (0/0) [origin]
    remotes/origin/update-documentation</code></pre>
</figure>

<p>Alot of information there, lets start with the first two lines</p>

<pre>
<code><span class='yellow'>storage-node-metadata</span> (1/5) [origin]
    remotes/origin/storage-node-metadata</code></pre>

<p>The first line has the branch name <code>storage-node-metadata</code>
Followed in parens by how many new commits this branch introduces on top of
<code>master</code> (commits ahead). Next is a slash <code>/</code> followed by
the number of commits master has that are missing from this branch (commits
behind).  Following that in brackets is the name of the remote repo this branch
is tracking, in this case we are tracking <code>[origin]</code>.</p>

<p>In short this one line provides the following: 
<code>branch-name (commits ahead/commits behind) [name-of-tracking-remote]</code></p>

<p>The second line in our example is indented and shows a list of remotes where this branch
exists. I published this branch to my github fork of the project so it
only shows 1 entry for origin. Knowing what other remotes have this branch can
be very helpful. If for instance you are collaborating on a single branch.</p>

<p>So in review, the <code>storage-node-metadata</code> branch has 1 commit not
merged into master, and is 5 commits behind master</p>

<h4>Master</h4>
<p>Now lets look at <code>master</code></p>
<pre>
<code><span class='yellow'>master</span> [origin]
     remotes/origin/master
     remotes/cory/master <span class='green'>is 17 commits behind</span>
     remotes/upstream/master <span class='red'>is 2 commits ahead</span></code></pre>

<p>Since it’s master it doesn't have commits ahead or behind <code>(0/0)</code>
and should always follow <code>[origin]</code>. The following indented lines
show all the remotes master can pull from. You can see
<code>remotes/cory/master</code> is 17 commits behind our master, this means
<strong><em>cory</em></strong> should pull from us or from upstream. You can also see
that upstream is 2 commits ahead, this means we should pull from upstream. <code>git
wtf</code> will also show if <strong><em>our</em></strong> master is ahead and
needs to be pushed.</p>

<h4>Tracking Remote Branches</h4>
<p>On the next line we see the <code>sqlalchemy08</code> branch.</p>

<pre><code><span class='yellow'>sqlalchemy08</span> (2/2) [cory]
    remotes/cory/sqlalchemy08</code></pre>

<p>In this branch cory has a patch to introduce sqlalchemy 8.0 into our project.
Since I was reviewing the patch I tracked cory's branch. You will
notice this branch tracks <code>[cory]</code> instead of <code>[origin]</code>.
Also notice <code>git wtf</code> shows us this branch has 2 commits ahead of
master, and 2 behind. I might need to rebase before I merge this branch into master.</p>

<h4>Collaborating on single branch</h4>
<p>Next we see the <code>volume-manager</code> branch.</p>

<pre><code><span class='yellow'>volume-manager</span> (5/0) [origin]
    remotes/origin/volume-manager
    remotes/cory/volume-manager <span class='green'>is 1 commits behind</span></code></pre>

<p>Me and cory are collaborating on this branch. <code>[origin]</code> tells us
the local branch is tracking origin but the following two indented lines shows
cory has this branch also. It also tells us cory's branch is 1 commit behind.
Which means he needs to pull from us.</p>

<h4>Un-published branches</h4>
<p>Moving on we see <code>branch-not-published</code></p>

<pre><code><span class='yellow'>branch-not-published</span> (2/0)</code></pre>

<p><code>(2/0)</code> tells us the branch has 2
commits ahead, and no commits behind. Also there is no
<code>[name-of-tracking-remote]</code> so we know this branch is not tracking a
remote. Notice there are no indented lines following this line. This means
there are no remote branches so we know this branch is local only.</p>

<h4>Already merged</h4>
<p>I originaly created <code>git wtf</code> to help me clean up already merged
branches. Often I do this clean up weeks or months after a branch has
been merged into master.</p>
<pre><code><span class='yellow'>update-documentation</span> (0/10) [origin]
    remotes/origin/update-documentation</code></pre>

<p>Here you can see this branch has already been merged, as it has no new
commits to provide and is behind master by 10 commits. which probably means it
hasn't been updated in a while</p>

<h4>Final Note</h4>

<p><code>git wtf</code> does not preform a <code>git fetch</code> to determine the
status of remote branches, you have to keep your local git repo updated by
preforming <code>git fetch</code> yourself. I made a helper script called 
<code>git fetch-all</code> which does exactly what it says, it runs <code>git fetch</code> for all
the remotes git knows about. You can get a copy 
<a href="https://github.com/thrawn01/dev-tools/blob/master/git-fetch-all">here</a></p>

<h4>TLDR</h4>
<p><code>git wtf</code> brings order to chaos and riches to poor git programmers.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Download a copy of the <code>git wtf</code> script from 
<a href="https://github.com/thrawn01/dev-tools/blob/master/git-wtf">here</a></p>

<h4>OSX</h4>
<p>
    <ol>
        <li>Chdir to git’s exec-path directory <code>cd `git --exec-path`</code></li>
        <li>Copy the script there and call it <code>git-wtf</code></li>
    </ol>
</p>

<h4>Ubuntu/Linux Distro’s</h4>
<p>On Ubuntu you have 2 options.</p>

<p>
    <ol>
        <li>Repeat the install instructions for OSX</li>
        <li>Place the <code>git-wtf</code> script somewhere in your local
        $PATH, where <code>git</code> will find it. I usually create a
        <code>~/bin</code> directory and add <code>~/bin</code> to my $PATH then 
        place <code>git-wtf</code> and all my other git helper scripts there.
    </ol>
</p>
